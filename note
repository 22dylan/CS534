Note for self regarding how to use git (i think)

1) write/modify code
2) git commit -am "commit message here"
3) git fetch
4) git push


What I think happens:
1) self explainatory
2) saves changes locally
3) pulls what is on github to local machine
4) pushes what is on local (plus what was obtained in 3) to github
<<<<<<< HEAD


Figure out how to get forks into master...
