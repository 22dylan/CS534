Note for self regarding how to use git (i think)

1) write/modify code
2) git commit -am "commit message here"
3) git fetch
4) git push


What I think happens:
1) self explainatory
2) saves changes locally
3) pulls what is on github to local machine
4) pushes what is on local (plus what was obtained in 3) to github


Figure out how to get forks into master...
