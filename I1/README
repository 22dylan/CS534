problem description
-------------------------
a set of training data representing housing characteristics (sq. footage, water view, etc.) was provided (X)
using the training data, the housing value was predicted (Y)
batch gradient descent was used to determine the slope factors (W)


how to run this submission
-------------------------
structure of folders: within codes, the files needed to run this project are:
  *implementation1.py (file used for training in pts. 1, 2, & 3)
  *BatchGradientDescent.py (wrapper for calculating the batch gradient descent)
  *run_bgd.py (function called in BatchGradientDescent.py)
  *validation.py (returns SSE of validation data after predicting Y with training weights)
  *test_training.py 
  
      these files call subcodes contained in a nested folder (fun_lib)
        subcodes needed for these files are:
            *data_reader.py (reads in and normalizes assigned csv files)
            *price.py (returns predicted price from training weights and test data to test_training.py)
            
        some additional codes used for data visualization and processing are:
            *pickle_to_csv.py
            *plotting_results.py
            *stats_plotting.py
            
 Results can be found in the output folder in both pickle and csv formats.
